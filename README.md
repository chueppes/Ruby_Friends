# Ruby_Friends
This is my fist ruby on rails project. It is a simple agenda, kind of a phonebook to manage your best friends in the world.
It has the functionalities of registrating so only you will be able to edit and see your list. To do so i used the gem devise, which made my work less 
difficult. ASAP i will be updating this project's repository so it looks as fine as my other ones.
